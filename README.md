# stock-market-prediction

This deep learning project consists of using different modules such as sklearn, tensorflow, pandas datareader, and many more. The objective of this project is to have a reference to what the next day price of a particular stock might be, but is not the only resource used for investment. Python is a powerful tool and has a lot of fun modules to work with. Data analysis, visualization, and prediction models using RNNs were all used within this project. UPDATE: some modules were updated and/or depricated, but the concept still stays the same.
